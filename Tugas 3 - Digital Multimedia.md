# Introduction

It was a dark and stormy night.

A storyteller might use these portentous words to capture your attention and draw you into a tale. A novelist might use the same words to begin the first page of a book. A radio play based on the same story could open with a crash of thunder and the howling of the wind. A film of the book could open on a scene of darkness, suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning that reveals trees bent over in the gale.

The dark and stormy night can be represented in different media, each of which tells the story through different means, appealing to different senses. One of the key insights in computing is that all these media can be represented digitally, as a structured collection of bits, and can then be manipulated by programs on a computer, stored on disks and other storage devices, and transmitted over networks. Their shared digital representation means that different media can be combined into what is loosely called multimedia.

The combination of different media is not something new. On the contrary, established forms mix media routinely. A TV news bulletin, for example, might include sound and moving pictures — both live and recorded — still images, such as photographs of politicians, graphic illustrations, such as a histogram showing the trend in unemployment, and text, in the form of subtitles, captions, quotations, and credits, which will usually be accompanie.

### Introduction

by suitable annunciatory music. A contemporary live theatrical performance may incorporate two- or three-dimensional artwork and design (sets, backdrops, costumes), sound, which may be a mixture of speech and live music, perhaps with tape recordings and synthesized sounds, projected still and moving images, and sometimes text in the form of surtitles (written text displayed above the stage, which are often used for translation, especially in opera). The integration of media is natural — we perceive the world through all the senses we have at once; the separation of media is artificial, and may often seem unsatisfactory.

Consider film, for example. From the earliest days of cinema, in the absence of any method of recording and playing sound in synchronization with picture, separate live sounds were produced at the same time as the film was shown: not just the live piano accompaniment that you may find in contemporary art-house cinema showings of silent classics, but dialogue, singing, and sound effects, produced by actors, singers, and noisemakers in the theatre, often hidden behind the screen. So great was the film-going public's desire to hear sound naturally integrated with moving pictures that in 1927 when Al Jolson spoke his phrase, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet,' in The Jazz Singer, audiences stood up and cheered. It is hardly surprising, then, that once the technical obstacles to representing media digitally (which we will consider in Chapter 2) were overcome, the next step should be to combine separate media. In fact, the separation of digital media into distinct data types — different 'sorts of things' to which different operations can be applied — can be seen as a temporary exigency demanded by an immature technology.

### Applications of Multimedia

from a computer user. In other words, digital multimedia can be interactive, in a way that, for example, a TV news bulletin is not, and that goes far beyond the simple control afforded by a VCR.

The digital multimedia version of the story we began this book with could open with a picture depicting a dark and stormy night. By clicking on an icon on the screen, the user could cause the scene to play as a video clip, or add sound effects, according to their choice. Perhaps by clicking on different areas of the scene, details could be revealed, or a new scene could be introduced — a different one for each part of the first scene, allowing the tangled tale of betrayal and redemption that began on that dark stormy night to unfold in more than one way, told through the eyes of different characters. Users whose hearing was poor could choose to have a transcription of any dialogue displayed for them, while users with impaired vision could have a description of what was happening 'read' to them by their computer. Different interface options might be offered for users with different tastes and needs. If the story had attracted critical attention, it might be possible to bring up learned commentaries on particular aspects, or a history of its telling in different media. There might be an opportunity for the user to take an active role, change the story, add new elements or recombine the existing ones.

Suppose, though, that this is not just a story — that some crime was committed on a real dark and stormy night, and that somebody had subsequently been arrested and charged with an offence. By collating evidence from witnesses, and facts about the location, the events of the night could be reconstructed and presented, like our story, as a mixture of animation, graphics, sound and video, with textual annotations. Members of the jury could then examine the event from different angles, verify that it was possible to see something at a certain distance, perhaps factor out the parts of the reconstruction based on a certain witness's evidence, or try out various hypotheses suggested by the lawyers in the case. Forensic multimedia of this sort is already being used in courts in the United States.
